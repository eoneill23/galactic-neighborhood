# Galactic Neighborhood

## Overview
Galactic Neighborhood is an app designed to provide information about our solar system as well as the International Space Station (ISS).

The home page includes NASA's astronomy picture of the day (APOD), asteroids near Earth, and the location of the ISS. Each individual planet page includes an image of the planet, a fun fact about the planet, and a form to calculate what the user's weight would be on the planet.
